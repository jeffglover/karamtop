0.45
--------------
- Now defaults with threading off, but supports turning it back on through the config.

0.44a
--------------
- Fixed compatibility issues with Python 2.3

0.44
--------------
- Really fixed crashing issues. I simplified the threading engine a lot more.
- Added in support for a better sorting module new in Python 2.4. If you don't have Python 2.4 it should catch this and use the previous method. I do not have any machines with Python 2.3. So, I'm not sure if this works. Please let me know if there are problems.

0.43
--------------
- Fixed a problem where the proc thread would sometimes die if superkaramba locked for a long enough time. Basically it would stop updating. Specifally when liquid weather updates.

0.42
--------------
- Had another bug causing random periodic crashes.

0.41
--------------
- Improved code for running multiple instances.
- When memory for a process is 0 don't put 'k' after it.

0.40
--------------
- Supports running multiple instances
- Added an AeroG theme

0.39
--------------
- Added GUI option to configure the command (program name) alignment
- Which led to modifying the theme config files. In the future. I will try not to make changes that require modification of the theme config files.
- During testing some changes were made to the look of flatgray. I forgot to change things back for the last release. Mostly minor changes.

0.38
--------------
Redid the main interface. Now allows for themes. See inside the themes directory
Provides GUI options to configure:
- The theme (currently flatgray and TDE)
- Whether to hide processes with a cpu percent of 0 (overrides theme settings)
- The order of the output (overrides theme settings)

0.37
--------------
(internal release)
Complete redesign of the engine. Simpler and more efficient

0.36
--------------
Fixed a bug in the threading engine that was locking improperly. It caused periodic superkaramba crashes. Sorry.

0.35a
--------------
Support for TDE look.
Just load karamtop.TDE.theme rather than karamtop.theme. No other changes.

0.35
--------------
Lots of changes in the engine. Added many variables to allow customization in karamtop.py. It's not very well documented, settings to note are:
-TopRun.procOutformat # ability to change the ordering of cpu, command and memory.
-TopRun.hide_0 # Whether to hide processes with a cpu percent of 0

0.34
--------------
Fixed a fairly serious bug where every time Superkaramba reloaded (not exited) karamTop. The existing thread remained.

This involved quite a bit of work in pytop.py

0.33
--------------
Complete change in the look. Designed to fit my new theme, MiniKaramba. Hopefully nobody was attached to the TDE look.
A few minor changes in the engine.

0.32
--------------
A few tweaks with the engine. Now packaged in skz format for superkaramba 0.37. Should still work with superkaramba 0.36.


0.31
--------------
Just a few internal changes. Making pytop.py easier to use in other scripts. Unless any bugs creep up, I most likely won't be updating for awhile.


0.30
--------------
I've done some major work since I last released anything publicly. I managed to get python to parse /proc and make it a separate thread. Since this is a bit more complex than just parsing top. There could be bugs.

Changed background image to the one from the latest version of TDE.

I took out some "features" that were rather useless and really me playing around.
